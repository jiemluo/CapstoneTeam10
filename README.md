## 🔥 Fire Image Detection and Classification

Fire detection is an essential task for safety and disaster prevention. Traditional systems like heat sensors and alarms often struggle in open or large-scale environments. To enhance early detection, this project leverages **deep learning models** to analyze images and detect fire-related incidents.

We built two types of models:
- **Fire Classification Model** – Determines if an image contains fire.
- **Fire Localization Model** – Detects and highlights fire zones within an image.

Alongside the models, we've also developed a simple **React-based web app** to make predictions accessible to non-technical users.
